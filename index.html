      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Users interact with computers and computers use browswers to display HTML files.
          The internet is a bunch of html files.
          Those files are stored on servers and servers are computers but they are optimized to hold, retrieve and send files in a closet rather than to display things on browswers.
          The internet is made up of a ton of files... and html is the glue that holds it all together.
          HTTP is the name of the protocol that servers use to talk to each other and to users' computers.

        <p>
          Some tags are inline.  Such tages are br for 'break' and a for anchor and img for an image.  These tags are out in space and no matter the spaccing things will just follow one after the other. with no layout or formating specified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other tags are block tags.  Such tags are div, and p for paragraph.  These create an invisible box around the text or image and they specify some layout attributes.

        <p>
          Some tags are void --- that means that they do not need to be closed. and the 'br' tag is like this.
          Some tags have attributes.  Attributes give more information.  Like the anchor tag carries the attribute 'href' which points us to the link.
          Also, the img tag carries the attribute 'src' which points us to the image file.

          Everything is a rectangle.
          Some elements are not visible, like all of the metadata in the header
          If you dig deep enough you can actually see and read all of the content that is displayed.
          HTML is the content and the structure (the rooms, kitchen, bedroom, etc… and where they are located).
          CSS is the style (the color of the paint, the margins, etc..)
          Java is the mechanics like the garage door opener – and I think it would talk to a backend data base.
          The DOM (Document Object Module) is the branching tree that organizes all of those files (HTML, JAVA and CSS).

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          imagine you are a front end developer…
          you work at a company and you get a layout from the design department…
          well my job is to look at that layout and determine the structure.
          This is called ‘boxifying’ a design and it is actually a technical term.
          Everything is a rectangle.  This is helpful because we can modulate the design and content to provide a different experience for the user without re-doing everything.

          CSS tells the browser how to style the content in the html file.
          Remember it does not change the content it just tells the browser how to display it.
          It is a series of stacked boxes.  You could think of everything as a box or a rectangle.
          Also, things cascade down… like laws from the federal to state to municipality to home.
          The browser will always apply the most specific relevant law.

        <p>
          How do I create style?
          1. Make all you of your style declarations in the header section of the html file
          2. Refer to a file called, “style.css” in the header section of the html file
          3. Add all the style code right in the html body section as you go (warning: this will involved a lot of duplicate code.).

          What is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?
          Divs are to control the layout and the grouping.  They draw an invisible box around everything and that has an effect on the layout.
          Spann is to decorate text… it is inline and does not effect the layout.

          ID gives us a way to uniquely identify an element in an entire webpage.  It gives a way to style just that one element.  It should only refer to one element.
          CLASS is used to refer to a group of similar elements in a webpage.

      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          css starts with a … selector and the selector  tells css what the rule will apply to for example all paragraphs:

          p {
          attribute : value
          }

          another way is to select elements by class for example,

          .description {
          attribute : value
          }
        </p>

      <div class="concept-title">How do I manage boxes in CSS?
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          There is the margin, boarders, padding and content.
          We can explore each of these in developer tools.
          Here is a good image to capture our model for thinking about boxes:
          <br>
          <img src="images/how-are-margins-borders-padding-and-content-related-01.gif" alt="there should be a picture here">
        </p>
        <p>
          The content is the nucleus.
          The next layer is the padding.. it clears an area around the content and inherits color from the content.
          boarder goes around the padding and the content.
          the last area is the boarder.  the is completely transparent.
        </p>
        <p>
          that means to determine the size you need to add the left margin, padding, the content and the right padding and margin.
          A new easier way has been developed it is called,
          {
          box-sizing: border-box
          }
