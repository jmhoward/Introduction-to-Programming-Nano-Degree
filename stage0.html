      How does the Internet work?
    </b></em>
    <p>
      Users interact with computers and computers use browswers to display HTML files.
      <br>The internet is a bunch of html files.
      <br>Those files are stored on servers and servers are computers but they are optimized to hold, retrieve and send files in a closet rather than to display things on browswers.
      <br>The internet is made up of a ton of files... and html is the glue that holds it all together.
      <br> HTTP is the name of the protocol that servers use to talk to each other and to users' computers.

    <b><em>
      What is the difference between Inline and Block tags?
    </em></b>
    <p>
      Some tags are inline.  Such tages are br for 'break' and a for anchor and img for an image.  These tags are out in space and no matter the spaccing things will just follow one after the other. with no layout or formating specified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other tags are block tags.  Such tags are div, and p for paragraph.  These create an invisible box around the text or image and they specify some layout attributes.
    </p>

      What are some other important notes from this lesson?
    </b></em>
    <p>
      Some tags are void --- that means that they do not need to be closed. and the 'br' tag is like this.
    </br>
      Some tags have attributes.  Attributes give more information.  Like the anchor tag carries the attribute 'href' which points us to the link.
      <br>
      Also, the img tag carries the attribute 'src' which points us to the image file.
